*** Docker 
*** ------

→ Docker provides 'consistency' across multiple environments and operating systems.
→ Two major concepts in Docker :

^ 1. Images :
    - Image is like a class or a recipe of a dish. It is a blueprint for containers.
    - Built from a Dockerfile.
^ 2. Containers :
    - Containers is like an object, a runnable instance of image.
    - We can run multiple containers from single imaage.

^ 3. Dockerfile :
    - Instruction to build a docker image.
^ 4. Docker Hub/Registery :
    - Store and share images.
    - DockerHub for Docker is like GitHub for Git.
^ 5. Volumes :
    - Persistent data storage for containers.
^ 6. Networks :
    - Cpmmunication between containers.
