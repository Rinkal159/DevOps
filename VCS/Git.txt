*** GIT in-depth
*** ------------

^ 1. Configure :
^ ______________

→ git config --global user.name '<name>'
→ git config --global user.email '<email>'

? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

^ 2. Export files on github :
^ ___________________________
    
    & i) LOCAL (vs code) to REMOTE (github)
    - Create a directory on local setup. (mkdir <dirname>)
    - Create a file in that directory. (touch <filename>)
    - Add few lines.
    - Command : git init
    - Create a Repo on Github
    - Command : git remote add origin <that_repo_link>
    - Command : git branch -M 'main'
    - Command : git push -u origin main

    & ii) REMOTE (github) to LOCAL (vs code)
    - Create a repo.
    - Command : git clone <that_repo_link>
    - Make few changes.
    - Command : git add <filename>
    - Command : git commit -m "<commit_msg>"
    - Command : git push -u origin main

? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

^ 3. Branch :
^ ___________

→ git branch :
    shows all branches

→ git branch -m <new_branch_name> : 
    to rename a branch

→ git checkout -b <branch_name> : 
    to create and switch to that new branch

→ git checkout <branch_name> : 
    to switch branch

→ git branch -d <branch_name> : 
    to delete a branch

→ git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch_name> :
    at the time of publishing new branch, this gets helpful. Now if we want to push that branch all the time after that command, we can just write 'git push' instead of writing every time 'git push origin <new_branch_name>' 

→→→ 'Content of the new branch depends on from which branch, the new branch is created' meaning if we create demo2 branch from main branch which does not have demo1 file then in demo2 branch, demo1 file will also be not displayed but if we create demo2 branch from demo1 branch which has demo1 file then demo2 branch has also demo1's content as well as main content.

? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

^ Pull Request :
^ ______________

→ Pull request is used to merge the changes made in other branches to the main branch.
→ demo1 branch has Demo1.txt file, main branch has not, because demo1 changes have not been merged to the main branch since PR is not raised, if we merge then all the demo1 branch content will be displayed on main branch.

    ^ Ways to raise PR :

    & i) From Github :
    → There, in the pull request section, we can compare 2 files.
    → Base branch is the 'main' branch and Compare branch will be that branch whose changes will append in the 'main' branch.(here 'main' branch does not mean 'main' branch, in this context, 'main' branch can be anything i.e. 'demo1' or 'supreme', etc.)
    → If there is not merge conflicts, then changes will smoothly apply to 'main' branch.

    →→→ NOTE : Here, Changes are merged in remote, in local setup, our 'main' branch is still behind by remote commits because merge is happned remotely, so if we want to stay updated then 'git pull' command will call all remote changes meaning now main has all demo1 content.

    & ii) From terminal :
    → First checkout to branch we want to append other branch's changes. meaning 'base' branch
    → There, write command : git merge <branch_name_whose_changes_will_append> 
    → After writing this command, VIM editor will open, there, commit message will be already written, if you want to rewrite it then you can, otherwise press 'esc' key to leave INSERT mode then write ':wq' to exit the editor.
    → Changes will be displayed on 'main' branch.

    →→→ NOTE : Here, Changes are merged in local setup, in remote, our 'main' branch is still behind by local changes because merge is happned locally, so if we want to stay updated in remote then 'git push' command will call all local changes in remote meaning now in github, 'main' has all demo1 content.

^ Merge conflict :
^ ________________

→ Merge conflict araise when two or more branches make changes on same line and wants to merge their code.
→ Git is in confusion state, is not able to think which branch's change should append to the requested branch.

→ I can think two scenarios of merge conflicts right now :

    1. We made changes in 'main' branch and as well as 'demo1' branch, and wants to merge 'demo1' changes to the 'main' branch, but 'main' branch has already content on that line, so this is now called a merge conflict.

    2. We made changes in 'demo1' branch and 'demo2' branch at the same time and on the same line, and first merged chnages of 'demo1' branch to 'main' branch and now we are trying to merge 'demo2' to 'main' but the problem is, 'main' is already merged with 'demo1' branch which has same content on that line, so now this is also called a merge conflict.

→ RESOLVE :
    → Resolve merge conflict in merge editor provided by vs code, where HEAD shows current branch's content and other content is from another branch.
    → Accept the branch you want to append changes to requested branch or there is also an option to append both branch changes.

→ After resolving conflict, must commit a message then push the code.

^ 3. Interesting Commands : 
^ _________________________

→ git log : to see all previous commits

? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

^ 4. Interesting Facts :
^ ______________________

→ In 'git remote add origin <repo_link>', origin is the alias of that repo link so that every time we push, we don't want to copy-paste that repo link. So, in 'git push -u origin main', origin is that repo_link where we push the code.
